- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @janiko71. Iâ€™m an Information Security Specialist and a CISSP â€” don't worry, I don't bite.
- ðŸ“° Part-time, Iâ€™m a freelance journalist for [next.ink](https://next.ink/public-profile/?id=41).
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m passionate about developing useful stuff (for me), usually in Python and occasionally in Go.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? Iâ€™m not a fan of social networks, but Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll figure it out!
